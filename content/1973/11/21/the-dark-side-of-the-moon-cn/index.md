  commit: ”今年顺着南京市民李线上，一路听上了 Pink Floyd，音乐和歌词都很棒。恰逢这张专辑发行50周年，知乎这位翻译歌词的小朋友只有17岁，真是后起之秀啊。“

以下是正文(绝大部分来源于歌词本）：

## 01 Speak To Me

I've been mad for fucking years

我的精神像这样反复无常已经有很多年了  

Absolutely years, been over the edge for yonks

已经有很多年了，但我还记得我年轻时那会  

Been working me buns off for bands

那时候我搞了个乐队

I've always been mad, I know I've been mad  

我一直这么反复——我自己也已意识到了

Like the most of us have

大部分与我患相同病症的人也一样

Very hard to explain why you're mad

我们很难解释是什么导致我们的神志不清

Even if you're not mad

（笑声）  

## 02 Breathe(In The Air)

**\[Verse - David Gilmour\]**

Breathe, breathe in the air

深吸气，品尝空气的芬芳

Don't be afraid to care

抛开诸多顾虑

Leave but don't leave me

去追逐你想要的生活，但请不要离我而去

Look around and choose your own ground

四下张望，找到你的立足之地

For long you live and high you fly

你所度过的漫长岁月，你所克服的重重困难

And smiles you'll give and tears you'll cry

你的欢笑和泪水

And all you touch and all you see

你经历和目睹过的一切

Is all your life will ever be

都会成为你人生全部的意义

Run, run rabbit run

跑吧，兔子，快跑

Dig that hole, forget the sun

忘掉你脑后的炎日，赶紧挖一个洞

And when at last the work is done

当所有工作完成的时候

Don't sit down, it's time to dig another one

不要懈怠，赶紧再挖一个

For long you live and high you fly

你已克服了生命中的重重险阻  

But only if you ride the tide

但如果你执意要随波逐流（应指Syd与60年代那帮滚青一样滥用药物）

And balanced on the biggest wave

试着在巨浪尖站定

You race toward an early grave

无异于自寻死路

## 03 On The Run

**\[Instrumental\]**

## 04 Time

**\[Instrumental Intro\]**

**\[Verse 1: David Gilmour & _Richard Wright_\]**

Ticking away the moments that make up a dull day

钟声滴答响起，时光毫无意义地流逝

You fritter and waste the hours in an offhand way

你就像这样肆意浪费着寸金光阴

Kicking around on a piece of ground in your home town

在你的故乡无所事事地来回踱步

Waiting for someone or something to show you the way  

寄心于有人能够为你指引前方的道路

_Tired of lying in the sunshine staying home to watch the rain_

_厌倦了沐浴在阳光里，于是蜷在家中看雨点落下_

_You are young and life is long and there is time to kill today_

_你认为你还年轻，人生又如此漫长，有的是时间可供挥霍_

_And then one day you find ten years have got behind you_

_当你幡然醒悟之时，十载年华匆匆流逝_

_No one told you when to run, you missed the starting gun_

_没人告诉你什么时候该起跑，你也已错过了发令枪响_

**\[Verse 2: David Gilmour & _Richard Wright_\]**

And you run and you run to catch up with the sun but it's sinking

你开始拼命奔跑，试图追上远去的太阳但业已日落西山

Racing around to come up behind you again

太阳再次东升时你猛然发现

The sun is the same in a relative way but you're older

它还是老样子，你却愈发苍老

Shorter of breath and one day closer to death

呼吸更加急促，离死亡又近一步

_Every year is getting shorter, never seem to find the time_

_每一年的时间似乎变得愈发短暂，再也挤不出空闲的时间_

_Plans that either come to naught or half a page of scribbled lines_

_你所定下的计划或是化作泡影，抑或是胎死腹中_

_Hanging on in quiet desperation is the English way_

最终只能以自己的方式沉醉于静谧的绝望里

_The time is gone, the song is over_

韶华逝矣，曲终人散  

_Thought I'd something more to say_

欲言又止

**\["Breathe" reprise: David Gilmour\]**

Home, home again

家，甜美的家

I like to be here when I can

总能为我带来心灵的慰藉

And when I come home cold and tired

当我身心俱疲回到家中时

Its good to warm my bones beside the fire

请容我在炉火旁小憩

Far away across the field

远在田垦之外  

The tolling of the iron bell

教堂钟声响起

Calls the faithful to their knees

呼唤着漂泊在外怀着乡愁的游子们  

To hear the softly spoken magic spell

回到他们魂牵梦萦的故土  

## 05 The Great Gig In The Sky

**\[Interlude\]**

“And I am not frightened of dying

'我从未害怕过死亡

Any time will do, I don't mind

让我任何时候离开这个世界都行，我不在意

Why should I be frightened of dying?

为什么要我害怕死呢？

There's no reason for it, you've gotta go sometime”

我想没有理由，每个人总有一天会死去”

  

**\[Vocals: Clare Torry\]**

I never said I was frightened of dying

我从来没有说过我害怕过死亡

## 06 Money

**\[Coin Intro\]**

**\[Verse 1: David Gilmour\]**

Money, get away

钱，走开点

Get a good job with good pay and you're okay

我只想要更好的工作，更高的薪资

Money, it's a gas

钱，我们都喜欢

Grab that cash with both hands and make a stash

有了现金就赶紧去存起来

New car, caviar, four star daydream

买一辆新车，尝尝黑鲟鱼子酱，过过有钱人的生活

Think I'll buy me a football team

**\[Verse 2: David Gilmour\]**

Money, get back

钱，快回来

I'm all right Jack keep your hands off of my stack

我才不会跟你分享我的财富，把你的脏手拿开

Money, it's a hit

钱，这是坠吼的

Don't give me that do goody good bullshit

别跟我提知足常乐

I'm in the high-fidelity first class traveling set

我正躺在一等舱的豪华皮椅上

And I think I need a Lear jet

想着买一架蒸汽飞机呢

**\[Solo\]**

**\[Verse 3: David Gilmour\]**

Money, it's a crime

钱，是罪恶

Share it fairly but don't take a slice of my pie

大家平分，但别打我这份的主意

Money, so they say

钱，他们都说

Is the root of all evil today

是现世的万恶之源

But if you ask for a rise

如果你要求加薪

It's no surprise that they're giving none away

他们是一个子儿都不会多给的

Away away away

Away away away

  

**\[Interview excerpts\]**

\- Yeah -- (chuckles) -- I was in the right!

\- Yes, absolutely in the right!

\- I certainly was in the right!

\- Yeah, I was definitely in the right. That geezer was cruising for a bruising!

\- Yeah!  

\- Why does anyone do anything?

\- I don't know, I was really drunk at the time!

\- I was just telling him it was in, he could get it in Number Two. He was asking why it wasn't coming up on freight eleven. After, I was yelling and screaming and telling him why it wasn't coming up on freight eleven. It came to a heavy blow, which sorted the matter out

## 07 Us And Them

**\[Verse 1: David Gilmour (backed by Richard Wright)\]**

Us and them

我们，和他们

And after all we're only ordinary men

终究不过只是普普通通的人

Me and you

我，和你

God only knows it's not what we would choose to do

谁都不知道，我们是否做出了正确的抉择

"Forward" he cried from the rear and the front rank died

"向前推进“将军下达指令；前线的战士们接连死去

And the general sat

将军又坐下

And the lines on the map moved from side to side

在地图上画着线条，将战线一步步推进

  

**\[Verse 2: David Gilmour (backed by Richard Wright)\]**

Black and blue

死亡和阴郁

And who knows which is which and who is who

没人能分清什么是什么，谁是谁  

Up and down

暂时的领先和落后

And in the end it's only round and round

一切只不过是无休止的往复

"Haven't you heard it's a battle of words?"

”你还没听说吗？这是一场没有硝烟的战争。“

The poster bearer cried

报童如此喊道

"Listen son", said the man with the gun

”听着孩子“持枪的男人说，

"There's room for you inside"

“你也能够成为我们的一员。”

**\[Interlude\]**

I mean, they're not gonna kill ya

So if you give 'em a quick short, sharp, shock, they won't do it again

Dig it? I mean he get off lightly

Cause I would've given him a thrashing

I only hit him once!

It was only a difference of opinion

But really, I mean good manners don't cost nothing do they, eh?

  

**\[Verse 3: David Gilmour (backed by Richard Wright)\]**

Down and out

落魄和潦倒  

It can't be helped but there's a lot of it about

这些事时刻发生，你却无能为力  

With, without

得与失  

And who'll deny it's what the fighting's all about?

这是我们战争全部的意义

And throw away the key
